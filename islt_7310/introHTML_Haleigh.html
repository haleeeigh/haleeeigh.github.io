    Bonjour, je m’appelle Haleigh Paige Lewis. After three years of French classes, that is all I learned. I am a psychology major. However, I have been considering changing my major as of recently to something that consists of a bit more creativity. I am a sophomore here at Mizzou and am originally from Kirksville, Missouri which was formerly known as the meth capital of America.  I assure you I never partook in such activities. I am a first generation college student and therefore, am kind of just winging this whole experience. I feel as though I'm doing a decent job. I don’t have very much time for hobbies but if I have any downtime, I tend to watch hit shows like Jersey Shore or Total Drama Island. I also love learning about true crime stories, as morbid as that might be.  Other than that, there’s not much more to know!
