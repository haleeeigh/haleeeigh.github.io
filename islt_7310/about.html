    <h3>My story</h3>

<body>
<p>My name is <em>Haleigh Lewis</em>. I am currently a sophomore at Mizzou studying psychology and will graduate in the spring of 2024. Although my major is psychology, <strong>fashion</strong> has always been a huge passion of mine. I have worked in retail since I turned 16 and am currently a part-time manager at Express, working as a stylist and as an associate at PacSun. <br><br>These two businesses sell very different styles and have the ability to help customers with both day to day dressing as well as business dressing. I mainly specialize in street wear however I can appreciate and help with fancier outfits. However, the most common problem I am asked to help with at either company is, what matches what, whether that be a suit and a tie or a pair of jeans and a top. With all of this experience, I have become quite skilled with the art of fashion. With fashion, there is a quote that I live by from <em>Miuccia Prada</em>:<blockquote>"What you wear is how you present yourself to the world, especially today, when human contacts are so quick. Fashion is instant language."</blockquote>
