        Welcome to my Theory on the Color Theory.
    </h3>
       
     
    
         I believe that if more people understood the true potential of all the variations of the color theory we would live in a more beautiful world. Many people tend to stick to the same basics that everyone else does, of which features very few colors. Walking around the campus during the summer is like living amongst clones that all wear lululemon shorts and tank tops. These same people look at high fashion and don’t understand the art behind it.<br/> <br/>Similar to makeup and hair, your fashion sense is just another way of expressing yourself, and in my opinion the most important one. However, many people don’t go out of their comfort zone with the worry that people may look down on them for it if they did. We live in a dull world void of color and expression and look down on the people that do.
